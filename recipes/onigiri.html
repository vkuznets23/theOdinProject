    <h3>Ingridients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups Japanese short-grain rice</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>Nori (seaweed) sheets, cut into strips (optional)</li>
        <li>Filling of your choice (e.g., pickled plum, tuna mayo, cooked salmon, or any other filling you like)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol><li><strong>Prepare the Rice</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch.</li>
            <li>Add the rinsed rice and 2 1/2 cups of water to a rice cooker or pot.</li>
            <li>Cook the rice according to the rice cooker's instructions or bring the pot to a boil, then cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook for about 15-20 minutes, 
            or until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><strong>Season the Rice</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until dissolved.</li>
            <li>Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large bowl. While the rice is still warm, gently fold in the vinegar mixture using a wooden spoon or spatula. 
                Allow the rice to cool slightly until it is comfortable to handle.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><strong>Shape the Onigiri</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Wet your hands with a mixture of water and a little salt to prevent the rice from sticking.</li>
            <li>Take a small amount of rice (about 2 tablespoons) and flatten it slightly in your hand. Place a small amount of your chosen filling in the center.</li>
            <li>Mold the rice around the filling into a triangle or oval shape, pressing gently but firmly to compact the rice.</li>
            <li>Optionally, wrap the formed onigiri with a strip of nori.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Onigiri can be eaten warm or at room temperature. They are perfect as a snack, in a bento box, or as a side dish. Enjoy!</p>
